# CEN4090L_Keyboard Racer

This is the 2nd repo for the project!
Our group has been having issues when it comes to getting Unity and GitHub to work together.
I had to make another Repository for the 2nd and 3rd increments instead of just adding an increment_2 branch.

Please refer back to the "CEN4090L_Unity" for our Issue Tracker.

The entire project is being created in Unity using their proprietary Collaborate software for version control. 
For the project iterations we are exporting the project to this GitHub repo for grading purposes.

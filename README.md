# CEN4090L_Keyboard Racer

This is the 3rd repo for the project!
Our group has been having issues when it comes to getting Unity and GitHub to work together.
I had to make another Repository for the 2nd and 3rd increments instead of just adding an increment_3 branch.

Please refer back to the "CEN4090L_Unity" for our Issue Tracker. Our issue tracker did not carry over, so we continued using the first repo's issue tracker for all of our issues.

The entire project was created in Unity using their proprietary Collaborate software for version control, as well as Plastic SCM in the final increment. 
For the project iterations we are exporting the project to this GitHub repo for grading purposes.
